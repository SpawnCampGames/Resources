## A Basic Analysis of Gun Attachments in Modern First Person Shooters

A Study by **SpawnCampGames**

## General Gun Stats
- Damage - (*Bullet damage, some ammo types cause additional stun/movement handicap*)
- Fire Rate - (*Consecutive fire rate or input cooldown for single-fire guns (pistol/sniper)*)
- Range - (*How far your bullets can fly before falling*)
- Accuracy - (*How close bullets land to the center of your crosshair*)
- Recoil Control - (*Weapon's horizontal and vertical recoil while firing*)
- Mobility - (*Strafe & sprint speeds while weapon is drawn*)
- Handling - (*Draw, stow, ADS & STF (sprint -> fire) speed*)
- Rounds/Ammo Type - (*Magazine capacity*)
- Reserve - (*Additional ammunition you spawn with*)


## Scopes

-   Red Dot Sights: Improve accuracy and target acquisition by providing a clear reticle for aiming. _(Accuracy+, Mobility+/-, Handling+)_
-   Optical Scopes: (Clear, Thermal, Night-vision, other): _(Accuracy+, Range+, Recoil Control+/-, Handling-)_
-   Canted Lasers: Replaces or Equipped alongside Other scopes. _(Accuracy+, Mobility+, Handling+/-)_

## Barrels

-   Short Barrels: Allows for increased mobility at the cost of power _(Mobility+, Handling+, Range-, Damage-, Recoil Control-)_
-   Long Barrels: Provides extra range and power, but reduces mobility _(Range+, Damage+, Mobility-, Handling-)_

## Muzzles

-   Suppressors & Silencers: Reduces weapon range, but improves recoil control _(Recoil Control+, Accuracy+, Range-, Damage-, Handling-)_
-   Muzzle Breaks: Reduces recoil by redirecting gas to counter muzzle rise, improving overall recoil control in both the vertical and horizontal axes _(Recoil Control+, Accuracy+/-, Range+/-, Damage+/-, Handling-)_. This attachment benefits all weapon types.
-   Muzzle Chokes: Used on shotguns to tighten bullet spread and increase effective range _(Range+, Damage+, Handling-)_, with potential impact on recoil control _(Recoil Control+/-)_
-   Flash Hiders: Increases recoil control by reducing the intensity of muzzle flash _(Recoil Control+, Accuracy+, Handling-)_
-  Compensator: Meant to mitigate muzzle climb and recoil (similar to a flash hider but less impact on the flash. _(Recoil Control+, Accuracy+, Handling-)_

## Under-Barrel Attachments

- Shotgun Underbarrel: _(Damage+, Handling-)_
- Grenade Launcher Underbarrel: _(Damage+, Handling-)_
- Grips
  - Handle Grips: Prioritize stability and accuracy, but slight mobility handicaps for the nature of being an attachment. _(Accuracy+, Recoil Control+, Handling+, Mobility-)_
  - Sharkfin Grips: Focused for agility and quick target acquisition with even less of an impact on mobility. _(Accuracy+, Recoil Control+, Handling+, Mobility-)_


## Magazines

-   Large Mags: Increase magazine capacity for extra firepower but at the cost of handling and mobility. _(Magazine Capacity+, Handling-, Mobility-)_
    
    -   Assault Rifles: Can provide magazine capacities of 30 to even 100 rounds with drum magazines.
    -   Handguns: Generally offering a capacity of 13 to 30 rounds.
    -   Shotguns and Snipers: Providing 5 to 9 rounds, depending on the specific weapon.
-   Small Mags: Decrease magazine capacity to prioritize mobility and faster reload speeds while sacrificing firepower. _(Magazine Capacity-, Handling+, Mobility+)_
    
    -   Assault Rifles: Reducing capacity from 30 rounds to around 20 rounds.
    -   Handguns: Typically limiting capacity from 13 to 9 rounds.
    -   Shotguns and Snipers: The impact on magazine capacity is negligible.


## Ammunition

-   Hollow Point: Increases the damage inflicted on targets. _(Damage+)_
-   Incendiary: Adds an incendiary effect to rounds, causing additional damage over time. _(Damage+, Fire Damage over Time)_
-   Armor Penetrating: Enhances the ability to penetrate armor, resulting in increased damage against armored targets. and ability to Wallbang targets (shooting through cover) _(Damage+, Armor Penetration)_


## Rear Grips

-   Grips: Enhances recoil control and may impact mobility. _(Recoil Control+, Mobility+/-)_
    -   Rubberized Grips: Adds additional material for a tackier hold, improving aim/accuracy stats and reducing flinch. However, it may weaken mobility and handling. _(Accuracy+, Flinch Resistance-, Mobility-, Handling-)_
    -   Skeleton Grips: Removes material for a lighter and slicker hold, increasing mobility and handling. However, it may reduce flinch resistance and aim/accuracy stats. _(Mobility+, Handling+, Flinch Resistance-, Accuracy-)_
    - Stippled Grips: Add stippling or texture to the grip surface for improved handling and mobility. However, they may slightly reduce accuracy. _(Handling+, Mobility+, Accuracy-)_

Rear grips offer different trade-offs between recoil control, mobility, and handling. Rubberized grips prioritize stability and accuracy at the cost of mobility, while skeleton grips prioritize agility and quick handling at the expense of flinch resistance and aim/accuracy.


## Stocks

Stocks can have various effects on weapon performance, including aim, accuracy, recoil control, handling, and mobility. The specific impact depends on the type of stock chosen.

-   Stocks: Influence weapon handling, mobility, aim, accuracy, and recoil control. The effects can vary based on the design of the stock.
    
    -   Fixed Stocks: Larger and bulkier stocks that provide increased accuracy and aim stability, but can negatively impact handling and mobility. _(Accuracy+, Aim+, Recoil Control+, Handling-, Mobility-)_
        
    -   Folding Stocks: Compact and lightweight stocks that improve handling and mobility, allowing for quicker weapon manipulation, but can negatively affect aim and accuracy. _(Handling+, Mobility+, Aim-, Accuracy-)_
        
    -   Skeleton Stocks: Minimalistic stocks that reduce weight and bulk, enhancing handling and mobility. However, they may sacrifice aim stability and accuracy. _(Handling+, Mobility+, Aim-, Accuracy-)_
        
    -   Stock Removal: Removing the stock altogether provides maximum handling and mobility benefits. However, it severely hampers aim stability and accuracy, as well as recoil control. _(Handling+, Mobility+, Aim-, Accuracy-, Recoil Control-)_
        

Different stocks offer trade-offs between accuracy, aim stability, handling, and mobility. Larger stocks enhance stability and accuracy at the expense of handling and mobility. Folding stocks and skeleton stocks prioritize quick handling and mobility, but may sacrifice aim stability and accuracy. Stock removal provides the highest level of handling and mobility but at the cost of aim stability, accuracy, and recoil control.

## Bolts (Long Rifles Only)
Lightweight Bolts: These bolts offer a quicker reload speed for single-shot rifles at the expense of Recoil Control. _(Fire Rate+, Recoil Control-)_
