## üè∑Ô∏èPublic Variable

One simple way to reference a gameobject in Unity is to create a public variable:
```cs
public Apple referenceToApple;
```


Now the public field is visible in the inspector.

Any gameobject with an instance of the `Apple` class can simply be dragged and dropped into place.

and..

```cs
referenceToApple.BiteApple(); // or
referenceToApple.weightInGrams = 150;
```

‚≠êHowever if other scripts don't need to access it you can use Serialize Field instead, to keep the field private and still visible to you.

```cs
// This will also be visible in the inspector
[SerializeField]
public Apple referenceToApple;
```
