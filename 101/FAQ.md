# üìã Unity 101 F.A.Q.s

### How to Convert Materials to URP üé®
- Change the shader to a URP shader.
- Create new URP materials.
- Use the Material Upgrade Wizard: `Window > Rendering > Materials`.

### **The Three Commandments of `Awake` and `Start`**
- **Awake (<- Me):** Initialize internal components and variables (self-sufficiency).
- **Start (-> Them):** Interact with external objects or systems (dependencies).
- **Timing:** Never assume another object's `Start` has run in your `Awake`.

### **The Three Commandments of `OnTrigger` and `OnCollision`**
1. **Both items need a Collider** for the interaction to register.
2. **At least one item must have a Rigidbody** to enable physics-based interactions.
3. **Correct Collider Setup:** Ensure the appropriate Trigger or Collision settings (`isTrigger` checkbox) are configured based on your desired behavior.
