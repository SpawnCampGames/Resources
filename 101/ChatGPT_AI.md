### üñ•Ô∏è **ChatGPT**
#### Using AI Chatbots as a Learning Tool

> [!Warning]
> Using `AI` to write your code **without understanding** how it works is bad practice. üè≥Ô∏è  
> Blindly copying and pasting may work temporarily, but not knowing how to spot mistakes can lead to issues.  
> It *will* work ‚úîÔ∏è until it *doesn't* ‚úñÔ∏è.

- It's crucial to have a basic understanding of coding principles before relying too heavily on AI tools.  
While they can be invaluable for prototyping and accelerating work-flow, it's essential to oversee their outputs and comprehend their limitations.  

- It's important to question its methodology and understand the reasoning behind its suggestions.  
If you're simply using it to generate code, be vigilant for potential errors.  

> [!TIP]
> Fixing errors promptly can help avoid significant setbacks, as AI might unintentionally worsen problems while trying to resolve them.

#### ChatGPT and others like it can be excellent learning aids. *When Utilized Properly* -  
- Don't use it as your only source.
- Fact check frequently.
- Always research new ideas and topics presented to you.
- If you're confused about something ask it to go into more detail, or better yet, go search elsewhere.
- Once comfortably understood then you can copy-paste and build off of it. 

üëç By adopting a cautious and informed approach, you can harness the power of AI chatbots effectively while mitigating potential risks.
