### üîç About Unity 101 / Resources

Starting as beginners ourselves, we understand the challenges of learning Unity from scratch. It can feel overwhelming initially, but with persistence, coding concepts gradually "click" into place. We are dedicated to providing essential resources and supplementary content to support your journey into Unity game development. Whether you're new to game development or looking to expand your skills, we're here to help you succeed.

#### Resources

Beyond Unity 101, our Resources section gathers everything we can find about Unity. This includes:
- Wide range of assets,
- Unity-related repositories,
- Additional tools that developers might need throughout their projects.

#### 101 Contents

Unity 101 is your go-to section for beginner-friendly content, offering:
- Overviews of Unity-related code and assets,
- Cheatsheets of common classes and methods used in Unity,
- Links to tutorials, videos, articles, and more.

#### Our Commitment

We're committed to assisting beginners in Unity game development. We recognize the challenges of starting out, and our goal is to provide clear, accessible resources that streamline your learning journey. Whether you're navigating Unity's interface for the first time or delving into scripting, Unity 101 / Resources has something valuable for you.

#### What's Next

Every day, we grow and refine the Unity 101 section. Beyond our own projects like "KOSMIQ," a Space Adventure First Person Shooter, and our continuously updated "The-Kit" prototyping project template, we engage with fellow beginners in Unity's Official Discord and create additional assets and resources.

We learn something new every day from our interactions with beginners, addressing recurring challenges and difficult-to-grasp concepts. This informs our ongoing effort to share our insights effectively.

Your feedback and support inspire us to create more tutorials and resources tailored to your needs.
