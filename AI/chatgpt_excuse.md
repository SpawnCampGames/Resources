Dear Unity Channel members,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out today regarding the code I shared in the channel.
I understand that there have been some concerns expressed about the fact that the code was generated by an AI.
I would like to clarify a few points to alleviate any misapprehensions and hopefully encourage your assistance.
First and foremost, please know that I fully comprehend the code and its functionality. While it is true that an AI assisted in generating the code,
I have taken the time to thoroughly review and understand its contents. My intention in using AI to generate code was simply to expedite the process and save time.
Whether the code was authored by me or an AI, the core issue remains the sameâ€”I am facing a problem that requires your expertise and guidance.
I believe it is essential to emphasize that my primary objective is to learn and grow as a developer, and I value the expertise and support of this community.
I am confident in my ability to comprehend and implement the code, but I am currently struggling to identify the specific problem that is causing it to malfunction.
By collaborating and sharing our knowledge, we can collectively work towards resolving the issue at hand.
I kindly request your assistance in examining the code with fresh eyes, focusing on identifying the root cause of the problem rather than solely attributing it to its AI origin.
Together, we can effectively troubleshoot and find a solution.
I genuinely appreciate your understanding and willingness to help. If there are any reservations or concerns that you would like to address, please feel free to communicate them openly.
I am more than willing to engage in a constructive conversation and provide any additional information necessary to resolve any doubts.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your valuable insights and support in tackling the challenges I am facing.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
